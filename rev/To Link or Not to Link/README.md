# Writeup for To Link or Not to Link by Bilbin

The challenge gives an object file, a linker script, and the linked elf file. From the linker script, you can tell that key_object.o and another file flag_object.o were linked to make linked.elf. Each section represents a bit of the information held in each file, e.g. section `.1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` of linked.elf is the first bit of the ciphertext, with the size of the section either being 1 or 0. The linker script effectively xors each section in key_object.o and flag_object.o, so you just need to extract and xor the bits from the respective sections in linked.elf and key_object.o, and this gives the bits of the flag.
