# Writeup for Annnnnnny Second Now by Bilbin

The given binary computes the 90th fibonacci number in an unoptimized way, then takes the modulus of it with different numbers to compute each character of the flag. This technically prints the flag, but it will never finish running (in our lifetimes.) You just need to compute the 90th fibonacci number yourself in a more optimized way, and then take the moduluses to get the characters yourself.
