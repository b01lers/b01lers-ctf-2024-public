Its is a simple game challenge where the graphics make the game un playable, one can delete/replace the textures to make it somewhat playable, but then you realise there aren't enough coins to make it to the next level. Thus you need to use a memory scanner like cheat engine or a lua injector to artificially boost your coincount to 999 and then simple pick one more coin up to teleport to th flag.
