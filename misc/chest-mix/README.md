# Writeup for chest-mix by colbyjack

This challenge is a basic needle in a haystack problem, while it is technically possible to search through all ~90k chests, the intended (and much more sane) solution is to parse the world data programmatically to extract the flag. For example this could be done using python and [this parsing tool](https://github.com/intergalactyc/anvil-new), or any other method of parsing the world files.
