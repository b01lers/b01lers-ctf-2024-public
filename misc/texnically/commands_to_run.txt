/bin/sh run.sh 
If error occurs, run those three and try again:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
sudo systemctl restart docker.socket docker.service


docker run -it deploy_texnically

In another terminal
docker exec -it texnically bash
This allows you to get into the container with server.py and wrapper.sh

exit

Then run

nc localhost 4001

to make sure it works.
